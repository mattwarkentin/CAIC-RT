-----

## v1.1.0 (2020-04-XX)

### Major Changes

  - Length of stay in Critical Care and duration of use for Mechanical
    Ventilators have been updated to **9 days** from **20 days** based
    on emegring data from Italy, [Grasselli et
    al. (2020)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764365?utm_source=twitter).

### New Features

  - Age-stratified case distribution and severity table now supports
    users uploading CSV or Excel files with custom data

  - Multilingual: The tool now supports French and Spanish language
    translations, in addition to English (\#2).

  - Walkthrough: We have added a tutorial video walking through how to
    use and interpret the CAIC-RT tool

  - We have added a bookmark button to allow users to generate a URL
    that captures the current state of the inputs.
    
      - The URL allows users to return to the tool with the same inputs
        used previously.

  - New modal widget for helping users compute the mean length of stay
    in acute care for COVID-19 patients
    
      - This accounts for patient-time for those who only spent time in
        acute care, and also those who spent time in acute care before
        or after spending time in critical care.

## v1.0.2 (2020-03-28)

  - PDF report generation feature was added to tool

-----

## v1.0.1 (2020-03-25)

  - Minor bug fix for updating the feedback warning generated when the
    number of critical care beds was less than the number of mechanical
    ventilators
      - Previously, if the feedback warning was triggered when changing
        the critical care input, the feedback warning was not properly
        removed when the mechanical ventilator input was updated (and
        vice versa).
