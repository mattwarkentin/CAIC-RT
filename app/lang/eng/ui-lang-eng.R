# Instructions for Editing:
#
# We recommend opening the file/script in a full-featured text editor,
# such as RStudio, atom, or notepad++. These tools support text
# highlighting and spell-check, which makes editing easier.
#
# Do NOT edit anything on the left-hand side of the assignment (<-) arrow
#
# When editing the text, you will sometimes see words wrapped in curly
# braces (e.g. {var}). You can move these around as needed, but do not
# change the text inside the braces. These are used for string interpolation.
#
# Example:
# apples <- There are {number} apples in the basket.
# apples <- The number of apples in the basket is {number}.

## Interpretations ----

# n_* is the number of each resource available
# lou_* is the number of days using a resource
# *BedRate is the resource turnover rate
# rate* is the rate of COVID-19 patients requiring a resource
# max* is the maximum number of manageable COVID-19 cases

summary_acute <- 'Based on {n_acute} available acute care beds and an average length of stay of {lou_acute} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {acuteBedRate} beds per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring an acute care bed is {rateAcute} percent. Given this, your healthcare environment has the capacity to manage a maximum of {maxAcute} incident cases of COVID-19 per day.'

summary_crit <- 'Based on {n_crit} available critical care beds and an average length of stay of {lou_crit} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {critBedRate} beds per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring a critical care bed is {rateCrit} percent. Given this, your healthcare environment has the capacity to manage a maximum of {maxCrit} incident cases of COVID-19 per day.'

summary_vent <- 'Based on {n_vent} available mechanical ventilators and an average duration of use of {lou_vent} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {ventBedRate} ventilators per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring mechanical ventilation is {rateVent} percent.
