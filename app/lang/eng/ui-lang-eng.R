# Instructions for Editing:
#
# We recommend opening the file/script in a full-featured text editor,
# such as RStudio, atom or notepad++. These tools support text
# highlighting which makes editing easier.
# 
# Do NOT edit anything on the left side of the assignment arrow
# 
# When editing the text, you will sometimes see words
# wrapped in curly braces (e.g. {var}). You can move these around as needed
# But do not change the text inside the braces. These are used for
# string interpolation.

## Interpretations ----

summary_acute <- 'Based on {n_acute} available acute care beds and an average length of stay of {lou_acute} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {acuteBedRate} beds per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring an acute care bed is {rateAcute} percent. Given this, your healthcare environment has the capacity to manage a maximum of {maxAcute} incident cases of COVID-19 per day.'

summary_crit <- 'Based on {n_crit} available critical care beds and an average length of stay of {lou_crit} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {critBedRate} beds per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring a critical care bed is {rateCrit} percent. Given this, your healthcare environment has the capacity to manage a maximum of {maxCrit} incident cases of COVID-19 per day.'

summary_vent <- 'Based on {n_vent} available ventical care beds and an average length of stay of {lou_vent} days, at maximum capacity the expected turnover rate is {ventBedRate} beds per day. Based on the age-stratified case distribution, the proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring a ventical care bed is {rateVent} percent. Given this, your healthcare environment has the capacity to manage a maximum of {maxVent} incident cases of COVID-19 per day.'
