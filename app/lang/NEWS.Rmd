# CAIC-RT

## v1.1.0 (2020-04-05)

- Age-stratified case distribution and severity table now supports users uploading CSV or Excel files with custom data

- Multilingual: The tool now supports French and Spanish language translations, in addition to English (#2).

- Walkthrough: We have added a tutorial video walking through how to use and interpret the CAIC-RT tool

- We have added a bookmark button to allow users to generate a URL that captures the current state of the inputs.
  + The URL allows users to return to the tool with the same inputs used previously.

- New modal widget for helping users compute the mean length of stay in acute care for COVID-19 patients
  + This accounts for patient-time for those who only spent time in acute care, and also those who spent time in acute care before or after spending time in critical care.

## v1.0.2 (2020-03-28)

- PDF report generation feature was added to tool

## v1.0.1 (2020-03-25)

- Minor bug fix for updating the feedback warning generated when the number of critical care beds was less than the number of mechanical ventilators
  + Previously, if the feedback warning was triggered when changing the critical care input, the feedback warning was not properly removed when the mechanical ventilator input was updated (and vice versa).

## v1.0.0 (2020-03-24)

- Initial public tool deployment
